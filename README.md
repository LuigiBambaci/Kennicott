<h>KennicottXML</h>

KennicottXML is a project dedicated to the encoding of Benjamin Kennicott's apparatus in XML-TEI language. 
The encoding is carried out automatically by means of a parser, created using the ANTLR4 software (https://www.antlr.org/).
Below is the list of folders and their contents.

cfg: contains the context-free grammar (CFG) used by ANTLR4 for parsing the apparatus

tei: contains the final list of XML files according to the TEI international standard

txt: contains the digitized apparatus of the individual books of the Hebrew Bible in txt format

xml: contains the xml files resulting from parsing

xsl: contains the XSL-T style sheet needed to transform the XML code into TEI
